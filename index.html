                <h2 id="animations">CSS Animations</h2>
                <p>
                    Animations with CSS can many times be more of an art-form than web development.  Some examples of beautiful CSS animation designs can be found at the following sites: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.species-in-pieces.com" target="_blank">In Pieces: 30 Species, 30 Pieces</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.waaark.com" target="_blank">Waaark creative web studio</a></li>
                </ul>            
                <p>
                    However, most web developers generally don't spend much of their time with stunningly beautiful design. Instead, most web developers work on much more subtle animations, that "inform" the user without having to necessarily "tell" the user. Simple things that most people don't notice, but are imperative for ease of use. A good article advocating "why" animations are important in UI design, is <a href="https://medium.com/bridge-collection/improve-the-payment-experience-with-animations-3d1b0a9b810e" target="_blank">this one on Medium</a> written by User Interface Developer working at Stripe. <em class="yellow">Getting things to move is easy, but planning or designing how they should move is the hard part.</em>

                <h3>CSS3 Psuedo-classes</h3>
                <p>
                    Before we jump into animating CSS, lets talk about ways to trigger animations. One such way is to use <em class="yellow">CSS3 Psuedo-classes, which are selectors that specify a special state of the selected element(s). </em> A full list of pseudo-classes can be found on the MDN site, but we will be focusing on just 3 for now:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div:hover { 
    cursor: pointer;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue"><strong>Hover</strong> is triggered by a user mousing over the specific element.</em> This one is pretty simple and quite useful, though it is typically not triggered on mobile devices since those devices are usually touch based, not mouse based.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">input:focus { 
    color: red;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="green"><strong>Focus</strong> is triggered when an element "receives focus."</em> It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's tab key.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">button:active { 
    background: purple;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="purple"><strong>Active</strong> is triggered when an element is "being activated by the user."</em> This one can be a bit confusing, but a simple example of when this is triggered, can be seen when you hold down the mouse click on a button.
                </p>
                <p>To solidify what we have learned, we performed the following exercises:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/psuedoclass-exercise/index.html" target="_blank">psuedoclass-exercise</a></li>
                    <li><a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/animated-button/index.html" target="_blank">build an animated button</a></li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>CSS3 Transforms</h3>
                <p>
                    Transform lets you manipulate the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.  In other words, <em class="yellow">transforms let you move, warp, rotate and scale elements.</em>  When using transforms, you typically pass it a function that you'd like to have performed. A full list of the functions that can be found on the MDN site, but we will discuss a few of the popular ones below.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    transform: translateX(100px);
    transform: translateY(300px);
    transform: translate(100px, 300px); /* same as both above in one line */
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue"><strong>Translate</strong> moves an element.</em> We did a few examples to get a good understanding of the translate function here: <a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/transform-basics/translate.html" target="_blank">Transform: Translate.</a> An important thing to note with translate is that it should be used when you want to animate something and not for basic positioning.  This is because, the initial origin of that element will remain at the location, before the translation is performed. You can see how this is a problem when you try and highlight one of the boxes in the example link above. <em class="blue">So put an element where you want it first, and then perform any translations</em>.  You shouldn't try to do a translate on a translated element.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    transform: scaleX(2); /* doubles width*/
    transform: scaleY(0.5) /* halves height */
    transform: scale(2, 0.5) /* halves width, doubles height */
    transform-origin: left /* determines where scale starts*/
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="green"><strong>Scale</strong> alters the size of an element.</em> We did a few examples to get a good understanding of the scale function here: <a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/transform-basics/scale.html" target="_blank">Transform: Scale.</a> Something to keep in mind is that scale affects every aspect of the element, including the border, font, padding, etc... The default origin of the transfrom is at the center (both vertically and horizontally), so the element grows outward from the center.  We can change that by using the transform-origin property. <em class="green">Transform-origin can be used to determine the location of where the scale occurs from.</em>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="purple"><strong>Rotate</strong> allows us to... rotate things.</em> We did a few examples to get a good understanding of the rotate function here: <a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/transform-basics/rotations.html" target="_blank">Transform: Rotate.</a> Positive degrees are clockwise rotations while negative degrees are counter-clockwise rotations. <em class="purple">Transform-origin can be used to determine the location of where the rotate occurs from.</em>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    /* scale would overwrite rotate if below code is used */
    transform: rotate(90deg);
    transform: scale(2);
    /* proper way - overwrites both transforms above */
    transform: rotate(90deg) scale(2);    
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If you tried to apply two transformations on different lines, the second transform will actually overwrite the first transform. In order to get around this, you would have to <em class="yellow">place all transformations on a single transform</em> as shown above.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
        -ms-transform: rotate(180deg);
            transform: rotate(180deg);
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">Vendor prefixes are needed</em>, because as more experimental CSS properties are created, not all browsers implement them the same way or at the same time. But they clutter your workspace and can get tedious writing them all out. Also, keeping track of which are needed and which aren't is a big pain point.  To get around this, <em class="yellow">it is best to use an auto-prefixer.</em> The following is a website where you can type some code in and see the prefixes that are needed or not needed: <a href="http://autoprefixer.github.io/" target="_blank">autoprefixer</a>
                </p>
    
                <h3>CSS Transitions</h3>
                <p>
                    We have been translating, scaling, rotating, essentially moving things around, but we haven't been able to animate something yet.  We can rotate an element, but it's instantaneous and NOT animated.  <em class="yellow">Transitions allow us to control animation speed (and a few other properties) when changing CSS properties.</em> The following are the 4 transition properties that we can set for an animation:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div { 
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-duration: 0.5s;
    transition-duration: 3s, 1s;

    transition-property: background;
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-property: all;
    transition-property: color, opacity;

    transition-delay: 4s;
    transition-delay: 5ms, 10s;

    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    transition-timing-function: ease-out;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue">transition-duration is how long the transition should last.</em> You can have multiple durations if you have declared multiple different properties in your transition-property. <em class="green">transition-property allows us to specify which property should be transitioned.</em> Something to keep in mind when using transition-property is that you cannot specify just rotate or scale, and must instead use the generic transform. <em class="purple">transition-delay allows you to set how long of a pause before the transition begins.</em> You can have multiple durations if you have declared multiple different properties in your transition-property, similar to transition-duration.<em class="yellow">transition-timing-function allows you to control the "acceleration curve" for the transition.</em>  Some great examples of this can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function" target="_blank">MDN website.</a>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    /* transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay] */
    transition: opacity 1.5s ease-in 1;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Instead of having to write out each of the 4 transition properties, we can simply use the shorthand for transitions as seen above. We did a few examples to get a better understanding of transitions here: <a class="internal" href="02-intro-to-animations/transition-basics/index.html" target="_blank">Transition: Basics</a>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Although many properties can be transitioned, there are some that cannot.  A more important question however, is what properties "should" be transitioned.  <em class="yellow">If you are concerned with performance, these are the 4 properties that are recommended to be animated or transitioned</em>, all other properties have a performance hit.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>transform: translate()</li>
                    <li>transform: scale()</li>
                    <li>transform: rotate()</li>
                    <li>opacity;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For more information on why all other properties are less performant, you can read this <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/" target="_blank">article.</a>

                </p>
    
                <h3>CSS Keyframe Animation</h3>
                <p>
                    Like transitions, keyframes are another tool in our CSS animation arsenal, but unlike transitions, they allow us to build much more complex and multi-component, multi-state animations. <em class="yellow">Transitions allow us to animate a single state change, keyframes allow for much more complex multi-state animations.</em> A very basic, and admittedly ugly, example of an animation was done here: <a class="internal" href="03-keyframes/basics/ugly-rainbow.html" target="_blank">Keyframe Basics</a>
                </p>
                <div class="media">
                    <img src="03-keyframes/imgs/keyframes-diagram-01.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <pre><code class="language-css">@keyframes rainbowtext {
    0% {
        color: red;
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    50% {
        color: orange;
        font-size: 40px;
    }
    100% {
        color: blue;
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">The first step in setting up keyframes is to define the keyframes.</em>  When defining the the keyframes, you can choose any percentage step between 0 and 100.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    /* The usual animation properties */
    animation-name: rainbowtext;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-delay: 0s;
    
    /* The "newer" animation properties */
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-direction: forward;
    animation-play-state: paused;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">The second step is to apply the animation</em>  Something important to note, is that there is nothing triggering the example animation above.  As soon as the page loads, the animation will start running. Also, many of the properties are similar to transitions, except for 4 new ones. The 'animation-iteration-count' property is pretty simple to understand, you just use an integer or infinite to define how many times the animation should run. In fact, here is a small demo for the animation-iteration property: <a class="internal" href="03-keyframes/basics/iteration.html" target="_blank">animation-iteration demo</a>.  However, we will go into a bit more depth with the other three.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    animation-direction: forward;
    animation-direction: reverse;
    animation-direction: alternate;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue">The animation-direction property allows us to have the animation run in reverse or even alternate</em>, which would cause it to animate forward normally, and then reverse back to the original state.  It's a bit easier to see in practice, so here is an example that we worked on: <a class="internal" href="03-keyframes/basics/direction.html" target="_blank">animation-direction demo</a>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-fill-mode: backwards;
    animation-fill-mode: both;
    animation-fill-mode: none;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="green">The animation-fill-mode property specifies how an animation should apply styles before and after the animation.</em>  It's hard to explain, so this demo helps illustrate how it works: <a class="internal" href="03-keyframes/basics/fill-mode.html" target="_blank">animation-fill-mode demo</a>. The forwards option is particularly useful when you want to run an animation one time, and then have it stay in that end state instead of having it snap back to the initial state.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    animation-play-state: paused;
    animation-play-state: running;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="purple">The animation-play-state property specifies whether the animation is running or paused.</em> Many times, this property is manipulated in javascript, but to keep things simple, we used the css 'hover' pseudoclass: <a class="internal" href="03-keyframes/basics/play-state.html" target="_blank">animation-play-state demo</a>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">div {
    /* first time value always goes to duration, second goes to delay */
    animation: 3s ease-in 1s 2 reverse both paused slidin;
    animation: changecolor 3s linear 1s infinite;
    animation: jiggle 4s;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">You can use shorthand when writing animations</em>, but if you are using many properties, it can get quite dificult to read.  The order kind of matters, but it also kind of doesn't. For example, the first value that can be parsed as a time is assigned to the animation-duration property and the second one is assigned to animation-delay. But other than that, as long as your animation-name does not conflict with the other properties, the order does not matter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Layout has long been a pain point for web developers, and many have often turned to css frameworks like bootstrap or foundation to help make sense of the mess.  Until recently that is, with the introduction of flexbox and grid layout systems, building responsive layouts is easier than its ever been. It's a newish layout module that has been around for a couple of years, but wasn't widely adopted by the major browsers until now. <em class="yellow">Flexbox is a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container... even if their size is unknown.</em> The days of weird and hacky tricks using floats, clearfixes and tables to layout a page are finally gone. There is a bit of syntax to learn, and it may be a bit tricky in the beginning, but once you get passed that, layouts will be so much easier than they've ever been. A great reference for flexbox and it's many properties can be found at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks.</a>

                    To start using flex, all you need to do is set the display property of a container to flex. It really is that simple, the tricky part is configuring flex properly to fit your needs. 
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">.container {

When doing our example, we found that if we made our flex-item width's really big, flex would only allow them to get as big as the container allows.  If we made the containers too small, the flex-items would break free as well.

                <p>
                    Before moving on, we wanted to practice what we have learned by doing a quick exercise: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/exercise-sidebar/index.html" target="_blank">Exercise: Sidebar</a>.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">.container {

We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/align-items.html" target="_blank">align-items</a>.
                </p>

                    <em class="orange">align-content defines how space is distributed BETWEEN ROWS in flex containers, ALONG THE CROSS AXIS.</em> The unfortunate name of this property makes it easy to be confused with the align-items property.  So if we don't have multiple rows or any wrapping, then we won't have any space between the rows. Essentially, <em class="orange">this property only works if wrap is used, because it only affects the space between rows</em>. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/align-content.html" target="_blank">align-content</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solidify what we have learned, we tried making a very simple navbar using flexbox: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/exercise-navbar/index.html" target="_blank">Exercise: Navbar</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Flex Item Properties</h3>
                <p>Up to this point, we have learned how to define flex container properties. Now we are going to take a look at the flex item properties so that we have control on the individual elements.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-css">.box-1 {
    display: flex;
    align-self: stretch; /* default value */
    align-self: flex-start;
    align-self: flex-end;
    align-self: center;
    align-self: baseline;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue">align-self allows you to override align-items on individual flex items, long the cross axis.</em> It is very similar to the align-items property, but align-self affects only the individual item. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/align-self.html" target="_blank">align-self</a>.
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-css">.box-1 {
    display: flex;
    order: 2;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="green">order specifies the order used to lay out items in their flex container.</em> If you were to use the code example up top, box-1 would move all the way to the right, not to the second position.  This is because <em class="green">all items by default have an order of 0.</em> Setting something to an order of -1 would move it all the way to the left.  Also, if the row or column is reversed, then the order is also reversed. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/order.html" target="_blank">order</a>.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">.box-1 {
    display: flex;
    flex-grow: 0; /* default value */
    flex-shrink: 1; /* default value */
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex: 0 1 100px; /* flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis] */
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Up to this point, all items have been the same size, but that can be changed using flexbox. <em class="yellow">flex defines how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the available space in a container.</em> flex is actually a shorthand property for:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em class="blue">flex-basis specifies the ideal size of a flex-item BEFORE it is placed into a flex container.</em> It's sort of like width, but it isn't. We can set flex-basis as the hypothetical ideal width, before they are placed in the container. A key distinction is that flex-basis is like width when working with rows, but it's like height when working with columns. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/flex-basis.html" target="_blank">flex-basis</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em class="green">flex-grow dictates how the unused space should be spread amongst flex items... and its all about ratios.</em> With flex-basis, there will sometimes be a lot of extra space left over, so flex-grow allows you to specify how the left over space gets separated among the items. If box-1 has flex-grow of 1 and box-2 has flex-grow of 2, that does not always mean that it will be twice as big; it means that it will use twice as much of the available space. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/flex-grow.html" target="_blank">flex-grow</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em class="purple">flex-shrink dictates how items should shrink when there isn't enough space in the container.</em> Setting a flex-shrink to 0 prevents that item from shrinking and will even cause the items to break out of their containers. We practiced this a bit here: <a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/basics/flex-shrink.html" target="_blank">flex-shrink</a>.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Most times, the shorthand is used rather than the individual properties, but it was a good way to learn the different properties.  To practice we did the following two exercises:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="internal" href="04-flexbox/exercise-polygon-widget/index.html" target="_blank">Polygon.com widget</a>.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Lastly, here are some links to practice the use of flexbox and css grids (which was not talked about in this course):</p>

                <h3>Callback functions</h3>
                <p>
                    A <em class="yellow">callback function is a function that is passed into another function as a parameter, and then invoked by that other function.</em> On the other hand, a <em class="blue">higher order function is a function that accepts a callback as a parameter.</em>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">function callback() {
    console.log("Coming from callback");
}
function higherOrder(fn) {
    console.log("About to call callback");
    fn();
    console.log("Callback has been invoked");
}

higherOrder(callback);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The code above shows an example of both a callback and a higher order function in use.  Callbacks are a very common pattern in javascript and are used in advanced array methods, browser events like button clicks, submit, dom content loaded, Ajax Requests, and a core concept in the React Framework that we will be learning later on in the course.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function sendMessageConsole(message) {
    console.log(message);
}
function sendMessageAlert(message) {
    alert(message);
}
function sendMessageConfirm(message) {
    return confirm(message);
}

sendMessageConsole("Message for console");
sendMessageAlert("Lots of duplication");
var answer = sendMessageConfirm("Are you sure?");</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Above is an example of code with a bit of code duplication, that can be improved with callbacks.  All of them essentially take a message as a string, and then perform some function on that message. Let's use callbacks to try and improve the code a bit.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function sendMessage(message, callback) {
    return callback(message);
}

sendMessage("Message for console", console.log);
sendMessage("Message for alert", alert);
var answer = sendMessage("Are you sure?", confirm);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The first step is to make a higher order function that accepts a message and a callback function.  Since console.log, alert, and confirm are all functions, we can use those as callbacks in our higher order function to actually send the message.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function greet(name, formatter) {
    return "Hello, " + formatter(name);
}

greet("Tim", function(name) {
    return name.ToUpperCase();
});</code></pre>
                <p>
                    A common pattern is to use an anonymous function as the callback, rather than a function declaration. In this example, we've passed in an anonymous function in the invocation of greet.
                </p>


                <h3>Practice: forEach</h3>
                <p>In order to get hands on practice with callbacks, we worked on creating our very own foreach function. </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function forEach(array, callback) {
    // To be implemented
}

// Callback signature
function callback(curElement, currentIndex, array) {
    // Implemented by the caller of forEach
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The forEach function, is a function that takes in an array and a callback as a parameter. Remember that the callback is NOT something that forEach implements, it is given to forEach as a parameter. It doesn't care what the callback does, it just invokes it for each element of the array. forEach will invoke your callback with three parameters every time, so you'll always get your current element, current index, and the entire array. Then it is up to the user of the function, whether or not they want to use all of the parameters.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function forEach(arr, callback) {
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        callback(arr[i], i, arr);
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Above is the completed forEach function. It takes an array, and then invokes the callback with the current element, current index and the entire array for each element in the array. This can be used to improve the code of many other functions. Below is one example:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
function double(arr) {
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log(arr[i] * 2);
    }
}

double(arr);</code></pre>
                <p>In this example, we have a function called double that takes an array and doubles it by 2. Our output to console should be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.  Next let's work on refactoring this code.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-js">var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
forEach(arr, function(number) {
    console.log(number * 2);
});</code></pre>


                <h3>Practice: findIndex</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to get hands on practice with callbacks, we worked on creating our very own findIndex function. findIndex returns the index of the first element in the array for which the callback returns a truthy value. If the callback never returns a truthy value, then -1 is returned.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function findIndex(array, callback) {
    // To be implemented
}

// Callback signature
function callback(curElement, currentIndex, array) {
    // Implemented by the caller of forEach
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Just like forEach, the findIndex function takes an array and a callback function. Also just like for each, the callback will have current element, current index and also the full array.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
findIndex(arr, function(num, index, array) {
    return num === 6;
});</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here is an example of findIndex in use.  The returned result should be 5, because findIndex should return the index of the first truthy value.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var langs = ["Java", "C++", "Python", "Ruby"];
findIndex(langs, function(lang, index, array) {
    return lang === "Javascript;
});</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here is another example of findIndex in use.  The returned result should be -1, because findIndex could not find a truthy value.  Given the examples and the definition of the findIndex function, we were given the task of creating the findIndex function on our own.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">function findIndex(array, callback) {
    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if(callback(array[i], i, array)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This is my code for the findIndex function.  I was pretty stoked, because I got it on my first try and even used similar code formatting to the instructor.
                </p>



                <h3>The Stack and the Heap</h3>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">The stack is an ordered structure that keeps track of function invocations.</em> It is part of the JavaScript runtime and it technically isn't something you have access to directly. <em class="yellow">Everytime you invoke a function, the stack gets modified to keep track of that function, and everytime a function is finished running, it will be popped off the stack.</em> You are not the one directly modifying the stack, the JavaScript runtime is doing that. So how does your code change the stack? Whenever you invoke a function, the details of the invocation are saved to the top of the stack (pushed to the top).  Whenever a function returns, the information about the invocation is taken off the top of the stack (popped off of the top).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue">The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called stack frames.</em> Each "frame" contains information about the function that was invoked, the parameters that were passed to the function and also the current line number. So in summary, the stack is an ordered set of stack frames. The most recently invoked function are on the top of the stack, while the bottom of the stack contains the first function invoked. The stack is always processed from top to bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em class="green">A heap is an area in memory where the data is stored.</em>
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">// The object is created in the heap.
// obj is a reference to the object.
var obj = {firstName: "Tim", lastName: "Garcia"};
// Not creating something new on the heap, only a copy of the reference
var referenceCopy = obj;</code></pre>
                <h3>setTimeout and setInterval</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we have some of the foundational material covered, we are going to move on and talk about two important functions that facilitate asynchronous code.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Runs in approx. 2000ms");
}, 2000);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">setTimeout is a function that asynchronously invokes a callback after a delay in milliseconds.</em> In the example above, we will console log that message two seconds after it is invoked.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var timerId = setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Runs in 30 seconds");
}, 30000);

setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Canceling the firs setTimeout", timerId);
    clearTimeout(timerId);
}, 2000);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    At times you may want to cancel a setTimeout.  Everytime you call a setTimeout, it returns an id of that timeout and you can actually clear it if you are able to run it before the setTimeout delay runs out.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var num = 0;
setInterval(function() {
    num++;
    console.log("num: ", num);
}, 1000);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    <em class="blue">setInterval is a function that continually invokes a callback after every x millisenconds, where x is provided to setInterval.</em> In the example above, we are incrementing num and console logging it every second.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var num = 0;
var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
    num++;
    console.log("num: ", num);
    if (num === 3) {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
    }
}, 1000);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    And just like setTimeout, we can cancel setInterval by saving the id that is returned when invoking the function and then clearing it with the clearInterval function.
                </p>

                    After seeing Colts solution, I learned that I have a lot of improvement to make. First off, my variable naming was not as effective.  I used the variable name "time", whereas Colt used "seconds" and I believe that is much more descriptive and relevant to the function. I also noticed that Colt reduced the seconds variable immediately.  I assumed that we had to show the inputted time first, but his makes more sense. In fact, mine could be considered wrong, because the callback function of setInterval, does not run until after an interval already passes, thus my timer is off by a whole interval. 
                    
                    I feel that this exercise was a great little assignment.  The prior lessons prepared me to answer this question very quickly and although I made mistakes, I was able to understand why and know how to improve. In the future, I'll be sure to take more time and look over my code a bit more before submitting it.

                <h3>Event Loop & The Queue</h3>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">The queue is an ordered list of functions waiting to be placed on the stack.</em>  Functions in the queue are processed on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). <em class="blue">The Event Loop is a functionality in the JavsScript runtime that checks the queue when the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the front of the queue is placed in the stack.</em> So if you have a setTimeout function with a delay of zero, that callback will be put onto the queue and it will not complete until the stack is completely empty.  Once it is, the Event Loop will then put it onto the stack for it to be completed.  So even with a delay of zero, it will NOT run immediately, instead, it will run once the stack is cleared. This leads to the next important point, that <em class="green">JavaScript is single threaded; the code execution is linear.</em>  Code that is running cannot be interrupted by something else going on in the program.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Hello from the timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("Starting loop");
for (var i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    var x = i * 2;
}
console.log("Done with loop");</code></pre>
                <p>
                    To further illustrate JavaScripts single-threadeded behavior, the above example shows a timeout function with a callback that should run in 0 seconds. However, it actually means to invoke that callback, 0 seconds after the stack is empty. So after we've invoked the said timeout, console message is logged and then we have a for loop that is going to take some time, since it's looping over a very large number. After the loop, another console messaged is logged, and only after this, will the callback be run.  This is because the callback is put on the queue, and the Event Loop will only add the queued functions once the stack is empty.

                <h3>Promise Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    <em class="yellow">A Promise, in Javascript, is an object that represents a task that will be completed in the future.</em> An analogy is like taking a number at a government office before you can get helped.  The piece of paper you get is like your promise.  The help you get at the counter is like the invocation of your callback.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-js">var p1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
var num = Math.random();
    if(num < 0.5) {
        resolve(num);
    } else {
        reject(num);
    }
});

p1.then(function(result) {
    console.log("Success:", result);
}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
});</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Here is an example of creating a promise.  First we are using the promise constructor. The constructor function takes a single callback function. That function has two parameters, either a resolve function or a reject function. The asynchronous task will decide whether to invoke the resolve or reject depending on how it goes. If it is successful (in this case if the random number is less than 0.5) then resolve will be invoked and if it fails (random number greater than 0.5), reject will be invoked. This promise object is assigned to the p1 variable.  We can then use the ".then" function on this promise object to define the callback that will be invoked when resolve is invoked inside of the promise. So the variable 'num' is passed into the callback that gets invoked in the .then function. If the process does not complete successfully and the reject function is invoked, we can then handle that error using the ".catch" function of the promise object. 
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-js">var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    resolve(5);
});

promise.then(function(data) {
    return data * 2;
}).then(function(data) {
    return data + 20;
}).then(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The code above shows an example of promise chaining.  The promise value returned in the first '.then' callback, is returned as the value of the next '.then' callback.  In the example above, the resolved 5 is multiplied by 2 in the first '.then' and the value 10 is returned.  The second '.then' adds 20 to the 10 returned in the first '.then' and returns 30.  The third and final '.then' logs the returned 30 value from the second '.then' to the log. I may have worded that a bit confusingly, but essentially the console would log 30 due to the promise chaining.  Instead of a value, a '.then' function can also return a new promise and the next '.then' function would then apply to the new promise object. <em class="yellow">It is useful to understand how promises work (resolve, reject), but in practice you will often use promises that are returned to you.</em>

                <h3>AJAX</h3>
                <p>
                    Ajax is exciting because it literally opens up a whole new world of possibilities and things you can do with your applications. Ajax stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, and it's no longer a very good name since nowadays, XML isn't as popular as it used to be and has been replaced with the JSON data format instead. Problem is that AJAX just sounds so much better than AJOJ or other acronyms. Before we continue, lets talk about what AJAX is NOT.  Ajax is not a library, it isn't a framework and its not a technology. It's not a tool that someone created, nobody owns it or developed it. <em class="yellow">AJAX is simply an approach to web development, a concept, a way of building websites.</em> It's pretty much a different way of structuring apps, using existing tools and technology, but just putting them together in a certain way. <em class="yellow">With AJAX, websites can send and request data from a server in the background without disturbing the current page.</em>

                <p>
                    This project required us to build a sample marketing page for a website that offers adventure tours in the mountains. When the page is loaded, a couple of css animations fade into view and a beautiful image takes center stage.  You can also scroll down the page to see more details on the mountain adventures. This site uses flexbox and is also responsive.
